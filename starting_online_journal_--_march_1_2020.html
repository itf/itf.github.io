<p>
Hello everyone!
</p>

<p>
I will <del>force myself to</del> start writing about mundane things here, because <del>then maybe my day to day life will become more exciting, since I'll feel like I'm performing</del> it is a good opportunity to practice communication as well as keep memories for the future. I've tried keeping journals just for myself in the past, but I always <del>felt like it is a waste of time</del> thought that allowing others to read what I write was a better use of time, because maybe someone could resonate with some of the ideas I write and help them.
</p>

<p>
Right now life <del>fucking sucks, just like always</del> is pretty alright. Some main things on my mind:
</p>

<p>
I need to figure out how to get closer to people. I feel that everyone enjoys when I'm around, and even more, are usually fairly excited when I visit or talk to them. But it is extremely hard to get past this point of just being the fun acquaintance. Sometimes if it is caused by people thinking I'm hitting on them every time I'm just trying to get a closer friendship? Well, if someone has suggestions, I'm all ears.
</p>

<p>
I have too much work to do, and not a lot of energy to do it.
</p>

<p>
I want to learn how to tailor, and I'm thinking about getting a sewing machine to fix up clothes.
</p>

<p>
I really want to cook dinner for someone, so I have an excuse to cook fancy food. It is annoying cooking food just for myself.
</p>

<p>
I recently learned how to play Katyusha in the guitar. I'm thinking about pulling an all nighter to learn some songs in the piano. I'm thinking about getting a 30 button concertina and just learning how to play some folk songs.
</p>

<p>
I'm  making a very interesting dating website as a side project. I will release it only inside MIT, and I think it has the potential to be a 1-week fad. 
</p>

<p>
I have a tiny crush on a person, and I hope I'll get to spend more time with her; but life has been too busy. 
</p>

<p>
Maybe I should start studying physics and math in my free time again; instead I'm listening to the Worm Audiobook. It is pretty great tbh.
</p>

<p>
I'm staring at a list of unfinished posts that I should maybe finish some time. 
</p>
